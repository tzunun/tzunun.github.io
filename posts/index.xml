Machine Learning Data Science And are starting out on your own, or would like to know what your choices are other than the default Python for your OS, or Linux Distribution. I recommend Anaconda&amp;rsquo;s distribution of Python.
The benefits of Anaconda are: Optimized math libraries from Intel, which if you have an Intel processor take advantage of the built-in functionality of you processor</description></item><item><title>GNSS Project</title><link>https://tzunun.github.io/posts/gnss/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jun 2020 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://tzunun.github.io/posts/gnss/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>https://tzunun.github.io/posts/introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jun 2020 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://tzunun.github.io/posts/introduction/</guid><description>Greeting!

&amp;ndash;Although the site is functional, it is mostly for demonstration purposes. I worked on this project along with 3 engineers.

This ETF (exchange traded fund) was chosen because it tracks the Standard &amp;amp; Poor&amp;rsquo;s 500 index.
Results The model was able to provide a rudimentary prediction after 10 epochs, further training resulted in a more accurate prediction graph after 40 epochs.</description></item><item><title>The AI/ML Editor</title><link>https://tzunun.github.io/posts/vscode/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jun 2020 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://tzunun.github.io/posts/vscode/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen programming classes for beginners where the instructor recommends an IDE, in stead of a text editor. I think it just adds to the complexity of learning to program, sure there are still steps to learning in order to run your code or to install a plugin that will assist with linting and syntax highlight. But the steps to achieve these should be minimal so that those learning might spend time coding.</description></item><item><title>Vim Mode In Ipython</title><link>https://tzunun.github.io/posts/vim-mode/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jun 2020 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://tzunun.github.io/posts/vim-mode/</guid><description>Sometimes when I am writting code I need to use the Python3 REPL to test or write a function. I prefer to use Ipython because it does syntax highlight,indentation and other things that the regular Python repl doesn&amp;rsquo;t. Warning: When you add/modify a tool in your workflow, it inherently introduces complexity which may be more trouble than the benefit it provides.
I am in the process of learning vim, so I am always enabling vim-mode by any method available in the tools that I use.</description></item></channel></rss>
