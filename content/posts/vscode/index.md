I've seen programming classes for beginners where the instructor recommends an IDE, in stead of a text editor. I think it just adds to the complexity of learning to program, sure there are still steps to learning in order to run your code or to install a plugin that will assist with linting and syntax highlight. But the steps to achieve these should be minimal so that those learning might spend time coding.

For a text editor I prefer Visual Studio Code. The main reason is that it's free, the second is its simplicity. 

When you install Visual Studio Code the only thing you really need to learn to use it are the following icons.

The Icon in the bottom left is the one used to add functionality via plugins. That is it the rest are self explanatory or can be explained later when the person learning to program progresses into source control.

I personally like the simplicity and functionality of the UI. I also like that Solarized themes (light and dark) are included.

If I was a beginner having to decide which editor to use and my intended field is Linux administration, I would learn vim and then take advantage of vim-keybindings everywhere; the terminal, Ipython, JupyterLab and of course Visual Studio Code.
